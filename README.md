lncRNA Annotation Scripts for Immune Cell Studies

This repository contains a collection of Python and R scripts designed for lncRNA annotation in immune cells. Using these scripts, I successfully annotated both known and novel lncRNAs that are specific to each immune cell-types, which were identified through extensive bulk RNA-seq data anlaysis. The methodology and results are detailed in the following publication:
[Pyo S. (2023). Annotation of long non-coding RNA in human immune system. Master's thesis, Hanyang University](https://hanyang.dcollection.net/public_resource/pdf/200000652426_20241008231204.pdf)

The scripts include functionalities for data preprocessing, alignment, transcript assembly, annotation, DEG analysis and visualization.
