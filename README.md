# lncRNA Annotation Scripts for Immune Cell Studies

## Description
This repository contains a collection of Python and R scripts designed for the annotation of lncRNAs in immune cells. These scripts were used to annotate both known and novel lncRNAs as part of my master's thesis research. The complete methodology and results can be found in my thesis:

- **Pyo S. (2023). Annotation of long non-coding RNA in human immune system. Master's thesis, Hanyang University.** [Read the thesis](https://hanyang.dcollection.net/public_resource/pdf/200000652426_20241008231204.pdf)

The scripts include functionalities for data preprocessing, alignment, transcript assembly, annotation, DEG analysis and visualization.
